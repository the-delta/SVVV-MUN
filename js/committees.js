Much of its mandate concerns the examination of human rights questions, problems and crises. It partakes in a strong collaboration with the Human Rights Council, a relatively newly established body. Its analysis is used in the most considerate application of the Declaration of Human Rights and the preservation of international justice. Some of the topics the Third Committee has dealt with in the past include the advancement of women, protection of children, indigenous issues, the treatment of refugees, the promotion of fundamental freedoms through the elimination of racism and racial discrimination, and the promotion of the right to self- determination. SOCHUM has collaborated extensively with agencies like UNCEF, UNESCO, UNHCR, and UNODC, whose input has been paramount to confronting these severe social issues. Much like the other committees in the General Assembly, SOCHUM has limited administrative authority, in that it cannot demand certain actions to be taken. However, it is vital in analyzing serious social and cultural problems, initiating studies and making recommendations pertaining to these issues. In the past sixty-seven sessions of the General Assembly, the Third Committee has been of prime importance in its contributions to the realization of human rights and the reduction of international crime as well as a more fruitful international collaboration on social, humanitarian, cultural and educational forums.</p><br /><p><strong>&#62;Agenda:- Addressing the impact of juvenile delinquency and criminal behavior and measure to depreciate the trends</strong></p>';

It is that committee in which we usually seek the person who shows signs of being a good demagogue. This is the place where your adroitness can really pay you off, but a slight clumsiness with your words can land you into a sudden altercation as no one would let you walk away with it that easily. Persistent attempts from the opposition parties to question your facts and knowledge is quite usual here, but you need to act like a pachyderm and not give into their plan of action. Being expressive, influential and a tinge of slyness describes the profile of the winning leader here in this committee. Remember, a single statement can make or break the deal.</p><br /><p><strong>&#62;Agenda:- Discussing the Issue of Kashmir and AFSPA</strong></p>';
